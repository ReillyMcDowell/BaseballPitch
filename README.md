Realtime Baseball Pitch Predictions

This project focuses on scraping, analyzing, and predicting baseball pitches using Python. It includes tools to gather data (videos) and a framework for building prediction models. Eventually would like to use something like YOLOv11, RF-DETR, and/or SAM3/3D for computer vision predictions of what pitch is being thrown (60fps videos make SAM more diffucult but the 3D body models might be helpful?).

Project Structure

scrape.py: The main script used for data collection. It scrapes pitch videos/data.

pitch_videos: Directory where scraped video files are stored.
